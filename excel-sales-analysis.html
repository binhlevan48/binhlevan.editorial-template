									- Difficulties in extracting meaningful insights from the raw data due to its size and complexity.<br><br>
									Why is it necessary to build this dashboard? What is the goal of this dashboard?<br>
									- Provide a centralized and interactive platform for analyzing and monitoring sales performance<br><br>
									What is the goal of this dashboard?<br>
									The goals of the dashboard include:<br>
									
									- Enhanced Data Visualization: The dashboard will present the sales data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner, making it easier for stakeholders to interpret and analyze the information.<br>
										
									- Real-time Monitoring: The dashboard will provide up-to-date sales data, allowing stakeholders to track sales performance in real-time and identify any deviations or anomalies that require attention.<br>
										
									- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The dashboard will highlight important KPIs such as total sales, average order size, top-selling products, customer segments, and geographic sales distribution. This will enable stakeholders to quickly assess the overall performance of the business and identify areas for improvement.<br>
										
									- Trend Analysis: The dashboard will include time series analysis and trend visualizations to identify seasonal patterns, growth trends, and any significant changes in sales over time. This will help stakeholders make informed decisions and adjust their strategies accordingly.<br>

									<p style="font-size: 1.2em; text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
									1. Calculate Row_number of each factor Recency, Frequency, Monetary<br>
                                                                        Note: With the frequency and monetary factor, we should divide by contract_age<br>
									2. Calculating Recency score, Frequency score and Monetary score by using quartile base on row_number of each factor<br>
								        3. Synthesizing RFM score using concat() function
