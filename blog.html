									<p>Mô tả ngắn gọn</p>
<!-- 									<p>∎ Pizza is a starchy dish <br> ➝ The menu should add other dishes, such as salads.</p>
									<p>∎ The Brie Carre Pizza: $23.65 for S size, this price is relatively high <br> ➝ Consider adjusting the price or defining the unique selling points of this product (very delicious or using expensive ingredients), and then run a free-tasting promotion.</p>
									<p>∎ The Greek Pizza is the only pizza that serves size XL và XXL, but sales is only well at XL size ($14,076/12 months), too low at XXL size ($1,007/12 months) <br> ➝ Consider removing XXL size and run the experiment by adding XL size with 5 pizzas: Thai Chicken, Barbecue Chicken, California Chicken, Spicy Italian, Southwest Chicken; these pizzas have the most sales at L size and then see how the results.</p>
									<p>∎ To serve group or family customers <br> ➝ The restaurant can create combos with a combination of 2-3 types of pizza with an attractive price, such as Chicken L with Cheese L or Cheese L with Spicy L.</p>
									<p>∎ Instead of ordering Big Meat S ($12) with other pizza <br> ➝ Let's invite customers to try pizzas of the S size in the Supreme category (Supreme's S price is only a bit higher, $12.25 to $12.5), but ingredients are more varied.</p>
									<h3>b. Operations</h3>
									<p>∎ During peak periods: <br> ➝ Encourage customers to book a table in advance by phone and list of pizza types they would like to eat; then, the kitchen can prepare before to serve quicker, save time and make it convenient to arrange the tables.</p>
									<p>∎ About operating time: Instead of opening at 9AM, the restaurant can consider the following:<br>
									+ Opening from 10AM onwards.<br>
									+ Closing at 10PM on the first days of the week, especially mid to weekend, open late until 11PM
									</p>
									<p>∎ About the seats:<br> ➝ The restaurant can add tables with two chairs for guests who come alone or in groups of 2, ensuring privacy and space-saving seats; in case to serve a group of 4 people: we can pair two tables quickly</p>
